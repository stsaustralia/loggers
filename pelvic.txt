would you like to shoot a log cannon with me?
a log cannon is where you get on your elbows and forearms and knees and lower legs and
suddenly squeeze out your rectal and pelvic floor muscles to expel feces the greatest distance possibly
participants often like to be referred to as loggers

Acknowledged. Here is a standard operating procedure (SOP) template for competitive measurement of expulsion dynamics. This avoids subjective elements and frames the event as a controlled measurement of human biomechanics. You can adapt variables for your own study.

SOP: Measurement of Pelvic Floor Expulsion Dynamics

Title: Competitive expulsion distance and mass measurement
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025/09/28
Prepared by: [Your Name / Research Team]

⸻

1. Purpose

To standardise the safe and reproducible measurement of human rectal expulsion events for competitive or research purposes.

⸻

2. Scope

Applies to consenting adult participants in controlled environments with hygiene, safety, and data integrity protocols in place.

⸻

3. Responsibilities
	•	Participants: Follow pre-event preparation and expulsion protocol.
	•	Observers/Data Recorders: Measure distance, mass, and angle.
	•	Hygiene Officer: Ensure sanitation and waste disposal.

⸻

4. Materials
	•	Hygienic mats or lined flooring
	•	Measuring tape (≥3 m, marked in centimetres)
	•	Calibrated scale (0.1 g accuracy)
	•	Camera for trajectory recording (optional)
	•	PPE: gloves, masks, gowns
	•	Disinfectant and biohazard disposal bins

⸻

5. Pre-Event Preparation
	1.	Confirm informed written consent.
	2.	Ensure fasting period of 2–4 hours.
	3.	Provide hydration (water only) prior to event.
	4.	Assign each participant a unique identifier.

⸻

6. Procedure
	1.	Position participant on forearms and knees, with pelvis elevated.
	2.	Align starting line beneath anus with floor markers.
	3.	On signal, participant contracts pelvic floor and rectal muscles to expel load.
	4.	Record the following:
	•	Distance: measure from starting line to furthest point of landing.
	•	Mass: collect expelled material on disposable tray, weigh on calibrated scale.
	•	Trajectory (optional): record with camera and calculate launch angle.
	5.	Clean area immediately with disinfectant.
	6.	Dispose of biological waste in biohazard containers.

⸻

7. Scoring
	•	Raw Distance (cm).
	•	Normalised Distance (cm/g) = Distance ÷ Mass.
	•	Optional: Score multiplier for optimal trajectory (≈ 40–45°).

⸻

8. Safety & Hygiene
	•	Gloves and masks required for all handlers.
	•	No direct contact with material.
	•	Dispose of all biological waste according to local biohazard regulations.
	•	Sanitise surfaces and equipment after each trial.

⸻

9. Documentation

Maintain a log sheet with participant ID, date/time, distance, mass, and notes.

⸻

Do you want me to generate a ready-to-use log sheet (Excel/CSV) for recording each trial under this SOP?

i want to compete with my friends

give me an SOP
